# RSA-Implementation-and-Power-Analysis-SCA-
Implemented RSA in C using the Flint library, with and without CRT option for encryption and signing. Conducted side-channel power analysis on LPC55S16 microcontroller by NXP, using a 10Î© shunt resistor to measure power consumption. Adapted code to use mbedTLS library with MCUXpresso toolchain.
